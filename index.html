    <h2>Dragon Reflection</h2>
    <p> Working on this project brought about several challenges. I was grateful for every session to be record, thankfully I was able to go back and reference to any obstacle I came across. Working independently on this project made extremely nervous, however I gave me practice to work through problem son my own. Intially, I had trouble displaying my selected font and color scheme. I was stuck for days, trying and proof reading every selector. Finally, after stepping away for a minute, rewatching a few sessions, I came to realize that I was missing an asset for my main html document. Once I've inserted the proper link and created my style sheet, my font and color design appeared as desired! This was a huge accomplishment for me, as for my frustration was at an all time high. I also had a difficult time placing my pictures for my article. Luckily, I was able to meet with Madan for some assistance with positioning. </p>
    <p>If I had to start over, I would do my color scheme differently. I would also try to use a background picture and a different navigation method, similiar to Apple's website for a more mordern look. I am pretty much happy with everything else. I started this semester knowing nothing about web development. I am proud of myself for accomplishing a full web page with working links.</p>
    <p>If im being honest, I am in mys econd trimester of my pregnancy. I has taken a toll on me thus far, which caused me to get a little behind in this class. I was unable to create final draft of this project at a timely manner. I accept the loss. After the weeks I've had, I am proud of myself for pulling my final piece together.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive enhancement is a web development strategy that focuses on delivering a basic version of a website or web application to all users, regardless of the capabilities of their devices or browsers. The idea behind progressive enhancement is to start with a solid foundation that works for everyone, and then enhance the user experience for those with more advanced technology. Progressive enhancement is crucial in modern web development for several reasons:

    <ul>
<li>Accessibility: By starting with a basic version of the site that works for all users, including those with disabilities or using assistive technologies, progressive enhancement helps ensure accessibility for everyone.</li>
<li>Resilience: Building websites in layers makes them more resilient to changes in technology. If a userâ€™s browser does not support certain features, they can still access the core content and functionality of the site.</li>
<li>Performance: Progressive enhancement can improve performance by prioritizing essential content and functionality over unnecessary bells and whistles. This approach helps optimize loading times and overall user experience.</li>
<li>Future-Proofing: By focusing on core functionality first and then enhancing it based on capabilities, progressive enhancement future-proofs websites against new technologies and devices that may emerge.</li>
</ul>
